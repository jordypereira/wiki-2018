# Designing for emotion

## 1 Emotional Design

Emotional design is made by a person. It infuses work with handcrafted naturality.

> People will forgive shortcomings, follow your lead, and sing your praises if you reward them with positive emotion.

A design should be reliable and usable.

> Humans want to connect with real people.

## 2 Designing for humans

> We all have a common emotional lexicon guiding us through life.

### Baby-face bias

Humans are wired to to love babies. - large eyes, small nose and a prononounced forehead -

### We are looking for ourselves

Our subconcious likes proportions like Pythagoras and the golden ratio. This is because these ratios are found in the human body and we are only looking for things like ourselves.

### Patterns / Contrast

We reconginize things that aren't right.
- Visual contrast:  difference in shape, color, form, etc.
- Cognitive contrast:  difference in experiences or memories

Use contrast to make the important part stand out.


## Don't put too much on a page

When it's simple we have to think less. The more alternatives there are, the longer we need to make an decision.  

Aesthetics influence usability.
